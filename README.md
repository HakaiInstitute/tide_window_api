Absolutely! Here's a GitHub repo README.md for a project maintaining the API described by your openapi.json file.

# Tide Window API

## Description

This project provides an API for retrieving tide windows at various coastal stations. Tide windows are periods of time when the tide height falls within a specified range. This data can be useful for activities like fishing, boating, or coastal research.

**Important Note:** This tool remains under development. Results may occasionally be inaccurate, and URLs may be subject to change. Please use at your own risk.

## Usage

The Tide Window API has several useful endpoints:

* **List Available Stations (`/stations`)**
    - Returns a list of stations with or without coordinates.
* **Show Stations on a Map (`/stations/map`)**
    - Displays an interactive map with station locations.
* **Get Station-Specific Info (`/stations/{station_name}`)**
    - Provides detailed station information, including coordinates, if requested.
* **Interactive Tide Plot (`/tides/events/{station_name}/plot`)**
    - Generates a visual plot of tides, sunrise/sunset times, and specified tide windows for a chosen station and date range.
* **Tide Events in CSV Format (`/tides/events/{station_name}.csv`)**
    - Downloads tide events (low tides, high tides, sunrise, sunset) as a CSV file, including optional tide window data.
* **Tide Events in JSON Format (`/tides/events/{station_name}`)**
    -  Provides tide events in a structured JSON format, including optional tide window data.
* **Raw Tide Data (`/tides/{station_name}`)**
    - Returns a JSON array of tide measurements (time and height).

### Example Usage (Interactive Tide Plot)

```

## Parameters
